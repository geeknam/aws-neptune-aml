Development Notebook
=======================

- `pyspark-etl-aml.ipynb` contains ETL logic for transforming the raw AML file to Neptune Gremlin Loader compliant format.
For more details, refer to AWS docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load-tutorial-format-gremlin.html

- The notebook file above can be opened with Jupyter Notebook, it was mainly used for working out the ETL using pyspark.
It can be tweaked to run from your local development environment.
